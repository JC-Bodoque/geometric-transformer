 * An algorithm used to recursively construct a set of objects from the smallest
 * possible constituent parts. Given a set of k integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_k)
 * with a_1<a_2<...<a_k, a greedy algorithm can be used to find a vector of
 * coefficients (c_1, c_2, ..., c_k) such that sum_(i = 1)^k c_i a_i = c·a = n,
 * where c·a is the dot product, for some given integer n.
